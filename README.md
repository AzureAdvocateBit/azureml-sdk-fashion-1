# Azure ML SDK - Fashion MNIST

In this workshop we will look at the lifecycle of your projects: from data, to model and model to consumption in the real world. You can follow along with code samples shared, as well as use these examples to help you replicate this workshop with your own projects after the event. 

## The base dataset and model

The example model used in the code below is how to classify clothing into categories such as dresses, t-shirts, sandals, trainers etc. The dataset used is the Fashion MNIST dataset from Zalando the online fashion brand, find out more about this dataset here: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist 

## What is Azure Machine Learning?
Azure Machine Learning is a platform for developing and deploying your machine learning models. Use your favourite frameworks, libraries and tools to build and deploy your machine learning experiments with the help of the cloud.  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml?WT.mc_id=aisummit-github-amynic)


## Installation and Setup
You have many options for development environments to use with Azure Machine Learning - so take a look at the one your used to using or looking to setup: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-choose-a-dev-environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-choose-a-dev-environment?WT.mc_id=aisummit-github-amynic)

Once you have chosen an environment - follow the instructions here to configure this environment: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-environment?WT.mc_id=aisummit-github-amynic)

For these samples specifically I have tested:
* [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-environment#azure-notebooks-and-data-science-virtual-machine?WT.mc_id=aisummit-github-amynic) in Azure 
* [Jupyter setup on your own machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-environment#azure-notebooks-and-data-science-virtual-machine?WT.mc_id=aisummit-github-amynic)
